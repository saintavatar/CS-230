The Gaming Room, wants to further develop their game Draw It or Lose It which is currently available on android. 
The new version would be web based and is loosely based on the 1980’s television game Win, Lose or Draw. 
The game will consist of four rounds at one minute each, there are multiple teams whose goal is to guess the puzzle picture before their time runs out, the opposing teams would also have a chance to guess the puzzle afterwards.
During the development of my documentation, I started working though each area and gathering the information needed though research, I was so focused on the document that I completed all areas early. 
The nice part about this was being able to go back and revise areas the need improvement.
While developing the code, knowing exactly what was expected and what they expected from the application. 
My overall experience with the document was great, outside change that were addressed from feedback, I am happy with the design document.
The user’s needs are important since if this is not considered the application could face challenges with acceptance, overly complicated design and unnecessary changes. 
If user needs are front focused though the entire process, then reaching larger audiences from all walks of life is possible.
Using both the information from the client and the UML diagram, laid out a general path for design. Also proper planning for timeframe, requirements and design to compliment each other.
